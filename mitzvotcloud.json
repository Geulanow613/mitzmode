Reflect on the themes of impermanence and Divine protection that the sukkah represents, even if you can't build a full one yourself right now. Did you know?

The Shofar's blasts are symbolic: tekiyah, a long, unbroken blast, represents the simple, unified call to repentance. Shevarim, three shorter blasts, evoke slow sobbing: brokenness and regret for our shortcomings. Teruah, a series of at least 9 rapid staccato blasts, signifies a desperate plea for divine mercy. Imagine these sounds, and reflect on what they might mean coming from a shofar on the Day of Judgement (Rosh Hashanah).",
