Learn about this unique mitzvah and what it symbolizes. The sukkah, a temporary dwelling, reminds us of the fragility of life and the importance of trusting in G-d's protection. It also commemorates the Israelites' wandering in the desert, sheltered by Clouds of Glory provided by G-d Himself. Reflect on the themes of impermanence and Divine protection that the sukkah represents, even if you can't build a full one yourself right now. Did you know? The rabbis teach us that inside a kosher sukkah, the Shechinah (G-d's presence) comes and dwells with us! No wonder it's so many Jews' favorite holiday!",

The Shofar's blasts are symbolic: tekiyah, a long, unbroken blast, represents the simple, unified call to repentance. Shevarim, three shorter blasts, evoke slow sobbing: brokenness and regret for our shortcomings. Teruah, a series of at least 9 rapid staccato blasts, signifies a desperate plea for divine mercy. Imagine these sounds, and reflect on what they might mean coming from a shofar on the Day of Judgement (Rosh Hashanah).",
